# Todo-List-Java-GUI
Project OOP
The "TodoList GUI" project is a graphical user interface (GUI) application that helps users manage their daily tasks or to-do lists. It provides a convenient and intuitive way to organize, track, and prioritize tasks, ensuring efficient task management.

The application is built using Java, specifically utilizing Java's Swing library for creating the graphical interface. Swing offers a rich set of components and widgets that allow for the creation of interactive and visually appealing user interfaces.

Key features of the TodoList GUI project may include:

Task Creation: Users can create new tasks by entering relevant details such as the task title, description, due date, and priority level. The interface may include text fields, dropdown menus, and calendar selectors for ease of use.

Task List Display: The application displays the list of tasks in a visually organized manner, allowing users to view their tasks at a glance. Each task may be represented as a separate entry, displaying its title, due date, and priority level.

Task Filtering and Sorting: Users can filter and sort the tasks based on various criteria, such as due date, priority, or completion status. This functionality helps users focus on specific tasks or arrange them in the desired order.

Task Editing and Deletion: The application allows users to modify task details or delete tasks that are no longer relevant. Users can select a task from the list and make necessary changes using appropriate buttons or menu options.

Task Completion: Users can mark tasks as completed once they are finished. Completed tasks can be visually differentiated from active tasks, providing a sense of progress and accomplishment.

Task Reminders: The application may include reminders to notify users of approaching due dates or pending tasks. This feature ensures that users stay on top of their tasks and helps in meeting deadlines.

Overall, the "TodoList GUI" project offers an intuitive and user-friendly interface for managing tasks effectively. It combines the power of Java programming with the convenience of a graphical interface, providing users with a seamless task management experience.
